    "**Comment**: We chose these two hypothesis above to find out how does urban cities affect rural villages. Furthermore, we picked Eindhoven and village De Rips\n",
    "as the village is north east of Eindhoven, which is the most frequenct wind direction. The same reason applies to the second hypothesis.\n",

    "**Comment** : We are thinking of using machine learning models to compare the correlations between a more windi place (near the coast), namely, Rotterdam, and a less windy place (inland), namely, De Rips. It would be easy to calculate the mean absolute error or just look at the residual plot, whcih would tell us where (inland or coast) is the correleation between the concentration of NOx and windspeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, we chose hypothesis 1 as we want there to be a clear difference between the air qualities, because the second hypothesis includes Amsterdam and Utrecht whcih would not be that different. Furthermore, we discarded hypothesis 3 as we thought that this would be too easy."

    "1. What is the distance between Eindhoven and the village.\n",
    "2. Are there air quality sations in Eindhoven and rural village De Rips?\n",
    "3. Are there weather stations in Eindhoven and rural village De Rips?\n",
    "4. What does SW wind blowing from Eindhoven to De Rips mean specifically?\n",

    "6. What is the time frame of our investigation of data?\n",
    "7. What is be bearing of the village from Eindhoven?\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The distance is 26 kilometers.\n",
    "2. There are 3 air quality stations in both of the locations.\n",
    "3. There is 1 weather station in Eindhoven and no weather stations in the village De Rips.\n",
    "4. It means the wind that blows from Eindhoven at a bearing of 45 to 75 degrees, which is exactly in the direction of De Rips.\n",
    "5. We researched that the wind speed of SW wind in Eindhoven between 20 - 30 km/h was prevalent for 400 hours per year and between 30-40 km/h for over 200 hours, moreover, the wind speed was higher than 40 km/h for over 130 hours per year. We think it is enough for the wind to actually have an impact on the air quality of village De Rips, moreover, we will investigate the data when the wind speed is higher than $6.5 m/s$, which is around $20 km/h$.\n",

    "We have 3 options to choose from in Eindhoven as there are 3 different air quality stations and it is a high chance that at least on of them will be equipped with NOx concentration sensor. The same is for the village De Rips (there are 3 air quality stations).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weather:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one weather station in Eindhoven and we will most certainly use that one for our weather factors. \n",

    "We will use the jupyter notebook to manipulate the data and gather insightful information form it by using data mining methods, visualization technieques, data base manipulation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What data is needed (incl. sources):\n",
    "\n",
    "The needed data comprises of the wind direction and NOx concentration in Eindhoven from the weather station closest to SW orientation compared to De Rips, and the NOx concentration in De Rips captured from the AQ station with the most NE orientation compared to Eindhoven.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Other steps needed to analyze the hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data needs to be cleaned such that any empty, incorrect or variable wind directions or other factors are eliminated. In addition, the data must be sorted based on date and time, and models need to be fit and checked so that all other work is simpler and more efficient.\n",

    "The rural village De Rips, whcich it at a bearing of $60$ degrees and at a distance of $26$ kilometers from Eindhoven, will have an increase in $NO_x$ concentration measured in $\\mu g/m^{3}$ when the wind, with a sufficient wind speed, namely, $6.5 m/s$, at a bearing of $45$ to $75$ degrees blows in Eindhoven.\n"
